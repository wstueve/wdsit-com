```sh
npm run dev
```

The site will be available at `http://localhost:5173`

## 🧪 Testing

## 🚢 Deployment

### Google Cloud Run

Deploy to Cloud Run from source (no Docker required):

```sh
npm run deploy
```

Cloud Run will automatically containerize your application using Cloud Buildpacks and deploy it with global Cloud CDN distribution.

For detailed migration and setup instructions, see [MIGRATION_GUIDE.md](MIGRATION_GUIDE.md).

### CI/CD

GitHub Actions workflows:
- `.github/workflows/playwright.yml` - Run tests on PRs and main branch
- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` - Deploy from source to Cloud Run with gradual traffic migration
- Automated smoke tests after production deployments
- Test reports stored as artifacts
