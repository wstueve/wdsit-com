var baseName = "robain-app-icon";

// Get the active document
var doc = app.activeDocument;

// Get the user's desktop for output
var outputFolder = Folder.selectDialog("Select output folder for icons");
if (!outputFolder) {
    alert("No folder selected. Script cancelled.");
} else {
    // Save original size first
    var originalWidth = doc.width.as("px");
    var originalHeight = doc.height.as("px");
    
    // Process each size
    for (var i = 0; i < sizes.length; i++) {
        var size = sizes[i];
        
        // Duplicate document
        var tempDoc = doc.duplicate(baseName + "-" + size + "px", true);
        
        // Resize
        tempDoc.resizeImage(
            UnitValue(size, "px"),
            UnitValue(size, "px"),
            null,
            ResampleMethod.BICUBIC
        );
        
        // Export as PNG
        var pngFile = new File(outputFolder + "/" + baseName + "-" + size + ".png");
        var pngOptions = new PNGSaveOptions();
        pngOptions.compression = 9;

        tempDoc.saveAs(pngFile, pngOptions, true, Extension.LOWERCASE);
        
        // Close temp document
        tempDoc.close(SaveOptions.DONOTSAVECHANGES);
        
        // Progress
        app.activeDocument = doc; // Return focus to original
    }
    
    alert("Exported " + sizes.length + " icon sizes to:\n" + outputFolder.fsName);
}
```

**Usage:**
1. Open `robain-app-icon.psd` in Photoshop

if (!outputFolder) {
    alert("No folder selected. Script cancelled.");
} else {
    var doc = app.activeDocument;
    
    // Get base name from document name
    var docName = doc.name.replace(/\.[^\.]+$/, ''); // Remove extension
    
    // Export high-res version
    var pngFile = new File(outputFolder + "/" + docName + ".png");
    var pngOptions = new PNGSaveOptions();
    pngOptions.compression = 9;
    pngOptions.interlaced = false;
    
    doc.saveAs(pngFile, pngOptions, true, Extension.LOWERCASE);
    
    // Also export web-optimized version (50% size)

# Requires: brew install webp

# Colors for output
GREEN='\033[0;32m'
BLUE='\033[0;34m'
NC='\033[0m' # No Color

echo -e "${BLUE}=== Robain Image Optimization ===${NC}"

# Check if cwebp is installed
if ! command -v cwebp &> /dev/null; then
    echo "Error: cwebp not found. Install with: brew install webp"
    exit 1
fi

# Input folder
if [ -z "$1" ]; then
    echo "Usage: ./convert-to-webp.sh /path/to/images"
    exit 1
fi

INPUT_DIR="$1"
OUTPUT_DIR="${INPUT_DIR}/webp"

# Create output directory
mkdir -p "$OUTPUT_DIR"

# Process each PNG file
COUNT=0
for file in "$INPUT_DIR"/*.png; do
    if [ -f "$file" ]; then
        filename=$(basename "$file" .png)
        
        # Convert to WebP with 90% quality
        cwebp -q 90 "$file" -o "$OUTPUT_DIR/${filename}.webp"
        
        # Get file sizes
        ORIGINAL_SIZE=$(stat -f%z "$file")
        WEBP_SIZE=$(stat -f%z "$OUTPUT_DIR/${filename}.webp")
        SAVINGS=$(echo "scale=1; (1 - $WEBP_SIZE / $ORIGINAL_SIZE) * 100" | bc)
        
        echo -e "${GREEN}✓${NC} ${filename}.png → ${filename}.webp (${SAVINGS}% smaller)"
        COUNT=$((COUNT + 1))
    fi
done

echo -e "${BLUE}Converted ${COUNT} images to WebP${NC}"
echo -e "${BLUE}Output: ${OUTPUT_DIR}${NC}"
```

**Usage:**
```bash
chmod +x convert-to-webp.sh
./convert-to-webp.sh /path/to/exported/pngs
```

---

### Script 4: Create Favicon ICO (Multi-Resolution)
**Purpose:** Create Windows-compatible ICO file with multiple resolutions

**File:** `create-favicon-ico.sh`

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Create multi-resolution ICO file from PNG
# Requires: brew install imagemagick

echo "=== Create Favicon ICO ==="

if [ -z "$1" ]; then
    echo "Usage: ./create-favicon-ico.sh robain-app-icon.png"
    exit 1
fi

INPUT_FILE="$1"
OUTPUT_FILE="${INPUT_FILE%.png}.ico"

# Check if ImageMagick is installed
if ! command -v convert &> /dev/null; then
    echo "Error: ImageMagick not found. Install with: brew install imagemagick"
    exit 1
fi

echo "Converting $INPUT_FILE to multi-resolution ICO..."

# Create ICO with multiple sizes: 16, 32, 48, 64, 128, 256
convert "$INPUT_FILE" -define icon:auto-resize=256,128,64,48,32,16 "$OUTPUT_FILE"

echo "✓ Created: $OUTPUT_FILE"

# Show file size
SIZE=$(stat -f%z "$OUTPUT_FILE")
echo "File size: ${SIZE} bytes"
```

**Usage:**
```bash
chmod +x create-favicon-ico.sh
./create-favicon-ico.sh robain-app-icon-512.png
```

## Style Guide for Manual Editing

### Character Consistency Checklist
When manually editing or creating new Robain variations, ensure:

- [ ] Head shape is consistently rounded/egg-shaped
- [ ] Blue visor (#3B82F6) is the signature "eye" feature
- [ ] Metallic body has silver base with blue accents
- [ ] Professional blazer in navy blue (#1E40AF) when in business context
- [ ] Body proportions: Head is ~25% of total height
- [ ] Arms and legs are clearly robotic (joints visible)
- [ ] Character feels friendly, not threatening or overly mechanical
- [ ] Expressions are conveyed through visor shape/glow
- [ ] Background is clean (white or subtle gradients)
- [ ] Color palette stays within brand guidelines

### Do's and Don'ts

**DO:**
✅ Keep the design modern and clean  
✅ Use the established blue color palette  
✅ Make expressions friendly and approachable  
✅ Maintain consistency across all variations  
✅ Use transparency for flexible backgrounds  
✅ Export in multiple sizes for different use cases  

**DON'T:**
❌ Make the robot look menacing or aggressive  
❌ Use colors outside the brand palette  
❌ Over-complicate the design with too many details  
❌ Change the core character features (visor eyes, head shape)  
❌ Use low-resolution or pixelated images  
❌ Include copyrighted elements or trademarked symbols

## AI Image Generation Tips

### Best Practices

1. **Be Specific:** Include exact colors, poses, emotions, and context
2. **Reference Style:** Mention "vector art," "modern illustration," or specific art styles
3. **Composition:** Specify "centered," "rule of thirds," "dynamic angle," etc.
4. **Resolution:** Always request "4K resolution" or "high resolution"
5. **Iterate:** Generate 4-8 variations, then pick the best and refine
6. **Consistency:** Reuse successful prompt structures for character consistency

### Refinement Prompts

If first generation isn't perfect, use these refinement prompts:

**Make more professional:**
```
Make the character more professional and business-appropriate, increase the polish and corporate aesthetic, sharper details, cleaner lines
```

**Make more friendly:**
```
Make the character more approachable and friendly, softer features, warmer expression, less formal pose, more inviting body language
```

**Improve color consistency:**
```
Adjust colors to exactly match this palette: primary blue #3B82F6, dark blue #1E40AF, light blue #93C5FD. Ensure consistent blue tones throughout.
```

**Simplify for icon:**
```
Simplify the design for use as a small icon, reduce fine details, increase contrast, make features bolder and more recognizable at small sizes
```
